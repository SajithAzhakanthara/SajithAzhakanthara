# Hello. I'm Sajith, a digital craftsman

I'm passionate about creating experiences that are easy to use, accessible, and that meet the user's needs.

## About me

I'm a 31 year old developer living in India. I discovered my passion for coding after seeing my brother do it. I fell in love with using my creativity to build things for the web. Through persistence, self-discipline, and commitment, I achieved my goal of becoming a fullstack developer. What kept me on this journey is that I always find learning new things exciting and facing unfamiliar challenges. In addition to coding, I enjoy building side projects because it allows me to explore my creativity and accomplish exciting things.
